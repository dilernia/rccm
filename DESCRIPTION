Description: This package implements random covariance models for joint estimation 
    of multiple sparse precision matrices for Gaussian graphical models. 
    Methods implemented include the Random Covariance Model (RCM) and the
    Random Covariance Clustering Model (RCCM). The RCM utilizes a 
    Kullback-Leibler divergence penalty to induce similarity across matrices.
    The RCCM is a penalized model-based clustering method for joint 
    estimation of multiple sparse precision matrices which provides sparse
    subject-level matrices, cluster-level matrices, and estimated cluster assignments.
